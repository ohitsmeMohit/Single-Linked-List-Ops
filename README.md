# Single Linked List Operations

This repository contains the implementation of various operations on a singly linked list in both C++ and Python. The single linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the list. The code provided here allows you to perform operations such as inserting elements, deleting elements, and displaying the contents of the linked list.

## C++ Implementation

The C++ implementation of the single linked list operations can be found in the `cpp` directory. It includes the following files:

- `LinkedList.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of the linked list class and its member functions for various operations.
- `main.cpp`: This file provides an example usage of the linked list class, demonstrating how to perform the operations on a linked list.

To compile and run the C++ code, you can use any C++ compiler of your choice.

## Python Implementation

The Python implementation of the single linked list operations can be found in the `python` directory. It includes the following files:

- `linked_list.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `LinkedList` class and its methods for different operations on a linked list.
- `main.py`: This file provides an example usage of the `LinkedList` class, showcasing how to utilize the operations on a linked list.

To run the Python code, ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then simply execute the `main.py` file.

## Usage

To use the single linked list operations provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ohitsmeMohit/Single-Linked-List-Ops.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for either the C++ or Python implementation.

3. Modify the code or utilize it as-is for your specific needs. You can customize the data types and operations based on your requirements.

4. Compile and run the C++ code or execute the Python code, depending on the implementation you choose.
